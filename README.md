<h2>Billiard Physics Simulator

This project showcases the development of a billiard simulator from scratch, encompassing the development of a physics engine in C, a server that manages both the frontend and game state, and a user-friendly frontend interface. It was completed for the notorious CIS2750 class (commonly referred to as the "angel of death").

<h2>Physics Engine

The physics engine, developed in C, precisely simulates ball movements, collisions, and interactions. Key features of this physics engine include:

1.  **Ball Movement**: Realistic ball motions are implemented based on velocity, friction, and fundamental collision dynamics.
2.  **Collision Detection**: Accurate identification of collisions between balls, as well as between balls and walls.
3.  **Collision Resolution**: Effective management of collisions to determine the resulting velocities and directions of balls after impact.

<h2>Server

  
The server component of the project fulfills several roles, including delivering the frontend interface to users, managing the game state, and storing data in a database. Key functionalities of the server include:

1.  **Frontend Serving**: Providing a user-friendly frontend interface for players to engage with the billiards simulator.
2.  **Game State Management**: Overseeing the game state, including player actions and ball positions
3.  **Database Integration**: Storing and retrieving game states from a database

<h2>Front End

The frontend interface offers an intuitive and visually appealing platform for players to engage with the billiards simulator. Key features of the frontend include:

1.  **Game Interface**: Presenting the pool table, balls, cues, and other game elements in an attractive and engaging manner.
2.  **User Interaction**: Enabling players to interact with the game through mouse or touch controls for aiming and shooting.
